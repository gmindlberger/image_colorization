Image Colorization with Autoencoder

This project implements a neural network for automatic colorization of grayscale images. It uses architectures like UNet and UNetRes to enhance image quality.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to convert grayscale images into color images. A dataset of landscape images, downloaded from Kaggle, is used for training. The model is trained using a custom dataset and a PyTorch DataLoader.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Frameworks**: PyTorch, torchvision, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Additional Tools**: Kaggle API, PIL, tqdm

## Project Structure

- `data_prep.ipynb`: Script for preparing and renaming image files.
- `autoencoder.ipynb`: Main script for training and evaluating the model.
- `neuronal_networks_ic.py`, `neuronal_networks_unet.py`, etc.: Implementations of different model architectures.

## Installation
